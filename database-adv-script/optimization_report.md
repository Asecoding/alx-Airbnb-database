# Performance Analysis with EXPLAIN
`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`

`SELECT ...`

Look out for these clues in the output:

- Sequential Scans (Seq Scan): Slower than index scans.

- Nested Loop Joins: Can be slow if joining large tables without indexes.

- High Row Estimates: Indicates inefficient filtering or missing conditions.

- No Index Usage: Means your DB is scanning entire tables.

# Refactor Suggestions
1. Ensure Indexes on Key Columns
Use this if not done already:

`CREATE INDEX idx_booking_user ON Booking(user_id);`

`CREATE INDEX idx_booking_property ON Booking(property_id);`

`CREATE INDEX idx_payment_booking ON Payment(booking_id);`

`CREATE INDEX idx_booking_date ON Booking(booking_date);`

## 2. Trim Unneeded Columns
Select only whatâ€™s necessary. You might not need all user or property details every time.

3. Filter Early (If Applicable)
If you usually only want confirmed or recent bookings:

`WHERE b.status = 'confirmed' AND b.booking_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'`

That narrows result sets early.
